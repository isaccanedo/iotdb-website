For example, a trigger can listen for the data changes of time series <code>root.sg.a</code>, or time series that match the pattern <code>root.sg.*</code>. When you register a trigger, you can specify the path pattern that the trigger listens on through an SQL statement.</p><h2 id="trigger-type" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#trigger-type"><span>Trigger Type</span></a></h2><p>There are currently two types of triggers, and you can specify the type through an SQL statement when registering a trigger:</p><ul><li>Stateful triggers: The execution logic of this type of trigger may depend on data from multiple insertion statement . The framework will aggregate the data written by different nodes into the same trigger instance for calculation to retain context information. This type of trigger is usually used for sampling or statistical data aggregation for a period of time. information. Only one node in the cluster holds an instance of a stateful trigger.</li><li>Stateless triggers: The execution logic of the trigger is only related to the current input data. The framework does not need to aggregate the data of different nodes into the same trigger instance. This type of trigger is usually used for calculation of single row data and abnormal detection.
