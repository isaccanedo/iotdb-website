Registering a trigger is not an atomic operation. When registering a trigger, there will be an intermediate state in which some nodes in the cluster have registered the trigger, and some nodes have not yet registered successfully. To avoid write requests on some nodes being listened to by triggers and not being listened to on some nodes, we recommend not to perform writes when registering triggers.</li><li>When the node holding the stateful trigger instance goes down, we will try to restore the corresponding instance on another node.

If two JAR packages contain a <code>org.apache.iotdb.trigger.example.AlertListener</code> class, when <code>CREATE TRIGGER</code> uses this class, the system will randomly load the class in one of the JAR packages, which will eventually leads the inconsistent behavior of trigger and other issues.</li></ul>',2)]))}const c=t(s,[["render",n],["__file","Notes.html.vue"]]),l=JSON.parse('{"path":"/UserGuide/V1.0.x/Trigger/Notes.html","title":"Notes","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"Notes The trigger takes effect from the time of registration, and does not process the existing historical data. **That is, only insertion requests that occur after the trigger ...","head":[["link",{"rel":"alternate","hreflang":"zh-cn","href":"https://iotdb.apache.org/zh/UserGuide/V1.0.x/Trigger/Notes.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/V1.0.x/Trigger/Notes.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"IoTDB Website"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Notes"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Notes The trigger takes effect from the time of registration, and does not process the existing historical data. **That is, only insertion requests that occur after the trigger ..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale:alternate","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2023-07-10T03:11:17.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2023-07-10T03:11:17.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Notes\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2023-07-10T03:11:17.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1688958677000,"updatedTime":1688958677000,"contributors":[{"name":"CritasWang","email":"critas@outlook.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.46,"words":437},"filePathRelative":"UserGuide/V1.0.x/Trigger/Notes.md","localizedDate":"July 10, 2023","autoDesc":true}');export{c as comp,l as data};
